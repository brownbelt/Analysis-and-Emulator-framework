Script to emulate binaries of different architectures. Developed using pylibelf+unicorn.

It is a fun project I am working on. It do the following:

1. Trace instructions
2. Trace syscalls
3. Trace memory accesses

It is still a work in progress. When complete, it will help in debugging and analysing binaries of different architectures.

I work on it whenever I am free.
